# Plover output plugin for linux using uinput

If you experience any problems, feel free to open an issue, pull request or send a message on discord (`lilleaila`)! Before asking for help, please check if the plugin is enabled in the settings..

## Setup
Add your user to the `input` group, and add this `udev` rule:
```
KERNEL=="uinput", GROUP="input", MODE="0660", OPTIONS+="static_node=uinput"
```
Set the `PLOVER_UINPUT_LAYOUT` environment variable to your two-letter `xkb` keyboard layout, for example `us`, `no` or `fr`. This is not necessary if you're using a US keyboard.

## Unicode characters
If you want to use unicode characters, either `iBus` or `fcitx5` has to be installed. You should also increase the key press delay in plover if some characters do not output properly.
